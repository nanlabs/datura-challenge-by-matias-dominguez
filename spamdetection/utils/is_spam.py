def is_spam(message_obj):
    """
    Determines whether a message is spam based on a simplistic keyword matching approach.

    This function serves as a simplified example to illustrate the concept of message
    validation in a proof of concept (POC) for a system where a miner analyzes messages
    to detect spam. It is not intended for real-world spam detection, which would require
    more sophisticated methods.

    Parameters:
    - message_obj (dict): A dictionary object that must include 'id' and 'message'
      keys. The 'message' key contains the text of the message to be analyzed.

    Returns:
    - dict: A dictionary containing the original 'id', a boolean 'is_spam' indicating
      if the message is considered spam, and a 'confidence' field representing the
      confidence level of the spam assessment (set arbitrarily in this simple model).

    Example:
    >>> message_obj = {"id": 1, "message": "Earn money easily from your home!"}
    >>> is_spam(message_obj)
    {'id': 1, 'is_spam': True, 'confidence': 0.95}
    """
    
    # List of simple spam keywords for illustration purposes
    spam_keywords = ["earn money", "easily", "subscribe"]
    confidence = 0.95  # Arbitrary confidence level for this simplistic model
    
    # Checking if any spam keywords are present in the message
    if any(keyword in message_obj["message"].lower() for keyword in spam_keywords):
        return {"id": message_obj["id"], "is_spam": True, "confidence": confidence}
    else:
        return {"id": message_obj["id"], "is_spam": False, "confidence": 0.05}  # Low confidence for non-spam messages
    
# Example of how to use the function
# message_obj = {"id": 123, "message": "Earn money easily from your home!"}
# result = is_spam(message_obj)
# print(result)

"""
In a real-world scenario, spam detection would likely involve more advanced machine learning models
trained on large datasets of labeled messages. These models could utilize techniques such as natural
language processing (NLP) to understand the context and semantics of the messages, rather than relying
on simple keyword matching. Implementing such a model would require collecting a diverse set of training
data, selecting an appropriate model architecture (e.g., neural networks), and continuously updating the
model to adapt to new types of spam.

As a simple next iteration, the function above could import a pre-trained machine learning model and use
it to make predictions on the message text. This would allow for more accurate spam detection based on
the model's learned patterns and generalization capabilities.
